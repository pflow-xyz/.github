### Tools

**Pflow** is the foundation for composable, verifiable onchain logic.  
Our long-term vision is to make every contract a **model**, every model **interactive**, and every state transition **inspectable** — a transparent ecosystem for building and reasoning about decentralized systems.

* **[pflow.xyz](https://pflow.xyz)** — Design, simulate, and analyze Petri-net models directly in the browser.
* **[pflow.dev](https://pflow.dev)** - React based petri-net editor supports converting To/From Solidity.

### Why Petri Nets?

Petri nets are a time-tested mathematical formalism for modeling complex, concurrent systems — a perfect fit for the decentralized web.

* 🧠 **Intuitive** – A simple visual language that bridges developers and non-technical users.  
* 🔍 **Verifiable** – Every state and transition can be traced, simulated, and tested.  
* 🛠 **Composable** – Build reusable subnets, fork logic, or wrap models as modules.  
* 🧬 **Expressive** – Capture the dynamics of games, DAOs, or entire protocol economies.
