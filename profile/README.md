### Tools

Pflow is a Web3-native SDK for Visual State Machines, powered by Petri nets.

Our long-term vision is to become the hub for composable, verifiable onchain logic — where every contract is a model, every model is interactive, and every state transition is inspectable.

* 🌐 pflow.xyz – Design models in the browser and export as Solidity

* ⚙️ app.pflow.xyz – Interact with onchain interfaces & explore live contracts

* 🧪 ipns://pflow.eth – Fully decentralized hosting via IPFS (in progress)

### Current Focus
We’re advancing smart contract development by introducing Petri-net-based contracts — fully composable, testable, and visualizable.

* 🔁 Solidity generator available now at pflow.xyz

* 🧩 Gno.land integrations & interactive SVG sandboxes coming soon

* 📐 Modeling-as-code: create, verify, and fork contracts like software

### Why Petri Nets?
Petri nets are a time-tested formalism used to model complex, concurrent systems. They're ideal for Web3:

* 🧠 Intuitive – Simple visual language for devs and non-devs

* 🔍 Verifiable – Every state and transition can be simulated and tested

* 🛠 Composable – Reuse subnets, fork logic, or wrap modules

* 🧬 Expressive – Encode everything from game mechanics to DAO governance
